```swift
TestAppio.user.identify(
    userId: "U123456", //required
    name: "Jane Doe", //optional
    email: "jane.doe@example.com", //optional
    imageUrl: "https://url/to/sample-image.png", //optional
    traits: [  //optional
        "age": "30",
        "plan": "premium",
        "ab_test_variant": "variation_A"
    ]
)
```

## Traits
Traits are pieces of information about a user that you can include in an `identify` call. These traits can be diverse, ranging from demographics like age or gender, account-specific details like the user's subscription plan, or even data related to A/B test variations the user has encountered. The purpose of traits is to provide additional context and information about your users.

Including traits in your `identify` calls can be essential for personalization, analytics, and targeting. They help you understand your users better, segment them effectively, and tailor their experience based on their characteristics.

### UI Interactions <a name="ui-interactions"></a>
Make it effortless for users to provide feedback by showcasing the TestApp.io bar.

#### Use Cases
- **Feedback Collection**: Use `TestAppio.bar.show()` when you want to prompt users for feedback or when a particular app event or interaction occurs that you want insights on.

- **Custom User Experiences**: Use `TestAppio.bar.hide()` to hide the feedback bar during specific app interactions or when you don't want to distract users, for instance, during a payment process.

```swift
// To display the feedback bar
TestAppio.bar.show()

// To hide the feedback bar
TestAppio.bar.hide()
```

### Logging & Events <a name="logging-events"></a>

### Continuous Sessions <a name="continuous-sessions"></a>

The TestApp.io SDK employs a "continuous sessions" approach. This means that if a session becomes full or meets specific criteria, a new session is automatically initiated for the device, ensuring uninterrupted data capture.

### Application & Session Lifecycle <a name="lifecycle-events"></a>
The TestApp.io SDK seamlessly integrates with your app's lifecycle, automatically capturing key application events.


#### Session Events
| Event                  | Description                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Session start          | Marks the beginning of a new user session.                             |
| Session end            | Indicates the end of the current session.                              |
| Session expired        | Triggered when a session is deemed too old and is automatically ended. |
| Session resumed        | Indicates that a previously paused or backgrounded session is resumed. |


#### Lifecycle Events
| Event                  | Description                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application opened     | Triggered when the app is launched.                                   |
| Application active     | Indicates that the app is in the foreground and receiving events.     |
| Application foreground | Triggered when the app transitions from the background to the foreground. |
| Application backgrounded | Triggered when the app goes into the background.                     |
| Application terminated | Indicates that the app has been terminated, either by the user or the system. |

In addition to application events, the SDK diligently manages session lifecycle events, ensuring insights into user session behaviors.

### Advanced Configurations <a name="advanced-configurations"></a>

#### Offline Mode
Network unavailable? No worries. The SDK is built for resilience. In scenarios where the user's device is offline, the SDK will continue to capture all events, errors, and feedback. Once the network is restored, the SDK will automatically send the accumulated data in batches, ensuring no data loss.

#### Efficient Networking
The SDK employs batching and compression to ensure optimal network usage. This means fewer requests, reduced data usage, and faster event delivery.
